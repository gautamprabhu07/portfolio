## 2) Projects

### Project 1 — AI Resume Parser & Job Finder

- **Title:** AI Resume Parser & Job Finder
- **Role:** Developer
- **Short summary:** AI-powered web application that extracts structured data from resumes and enables intelligent job matching using NLP techniques.
- **Problem:** Recruiters and applicants struggle to extract structured information from unformatted resumes, leading to manual effort, parsing errors, and inefficient candidate screening.
- **Solution:** Built a resume parsing system using NLP to extract skills, experience, education, and contact details from PDF/DOC files, with validation, confidence handling, and fallback mechanisms for unreliable inputs.
- **Impact:** Handled unstructured resume formats with error-resilient parsing, multi-format file support, and confidence-aware extraction, enabling reliable structured data generation from noisy inputs.
- **Tech stack:** React, Python, Flask, spaCy, NLP, REST APIs

### Project 2 — Real Estate Marketplace Platform

- **Title:** Real Estate Marketplace Platform
- **Role:** Full-Stack Developer
- **Short summary:** Full-stack real estate platform with authentication, payments, real-time chat, and location-based property discovery.
- **Problem:** Traditional property listing platforms lack integrated communication, secure payments, and real-time interaction between buyers and sellers, leading to fragmented workflows.
- **Solution:** Developed a full-stack marketplace with JWT authentication, property CRUD operations, Stripe payments, real-time chat using Socket.io, media uploads, and map-based property search.
- **Impact:** Implemented end-to-end transaction workflows, real-time messaging, secure payments, and scalable backend APIs, simulating a production-grade property marketplace system.
- **Tech stack:** React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Socket.io, Stripe, Cloudinary

### Project 3 — Smart Campus Network Design

- **Title:** Smart Campus Network Design
- **Role:** Network Designer & Implementer
- **Short summary:** Enterprise-style campus network design with segmented VLAN architecture, dynamic routing, and secure inter-building connectivity simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer.
- **Problem:** Large campus environments require scalable, secure, and fault-tolerant networks to support multiple departments, devices, and services without congestion, broadcast storms, or security risks.
- **Solution:** Designed a multi-building campus network using VLAN segmentation per department, EIGRP dynamic routing between distribution layers, EtherChannel link aggregation, and port security, with validated end-to-end connectivity across services.
- **Impact:** Implemented a multi-VLAN, multi-router topology with dynamic routing, inter-VLAN communication, redundancy planning, and secure access control, simulating an enterprise-grade campus network architecture.
- **Tech stack:** Cisco Packet Tracer, EIGRP, VLANs, Inter-VLAN Routing, EtherChannel, Port Security
